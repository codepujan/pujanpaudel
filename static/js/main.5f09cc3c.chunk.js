Our method extracts topic embeddings from multiple views of a Twitter user feed and weights them according to their content authoring roles, where the authored tweets, replied tweets, retweeted tweets, and favorited tweets are the views we separate for constructing the embeddings. We test the proposed method using two different topic modeling algorithms: (i) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ii) Twitter-Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The users in our study are divided into multiple hierarchies based on their activity composition regarding individual topics, and the effectiveness of MFWTE is evaluated in the multi-hierarchical setting. The performance of our method on friendship recommendation and retweet behavior prediction task is evaluated using various ranked retrieval measures. The results indicate that our MFWTE method for topic modeling of Twitter users improves over various previous baselines.

The state-of-the-art tools have been able to detect a plethora of use cases of Twitter bots using network-level features and machine learning features, but a large portion of Twitter bots are still active in the platform. The ambiguity of the business model of Twitter to allow automated accounts, alongside its policy against automated activity has resulted in constant outgrowth in the bot population on Twitter. In light of recent controversies and concerns of the US government, Twitter has taken steps to regulate the automated accounts and pruned a large magnitude of the bots. Despite its efforts, the majority of the accounts belonging to the same Botnet campaign, or operation have been still active on the platform. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the deleted and still persistent accounts belonging to the same bot campaign for three different previously bot campaigns from the literature. We compare and contrast the network-based, content-based and diffusion-based characteristics of the extinguished and persistent bots and reason what makes these bots undetected from Twitter\u2019s platform moderation. We hope to extract the multiple dimensions of this blind spot of Twitter bot detection and also discuss the consequences these further undetected accounts may have, on further re-use of them in different disinformation campaigns, as it has been shown that automated accounts are used across social movements (e.g Brexit and US election). We discuss on the survivability of the active accounts and its correlation with the activity and influence of the bots. Finally, we also extract multi-dimensional features of these surviving accounts which could be further used to improve real-time bot detection systems and help in exploratory bot detection on the wild."}),i.a.createElement(T,{title:"Started from the bottom, now  we are here.
